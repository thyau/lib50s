# lib50s

This is a very rough prototype of a graphics engine intended for a 1950's themed zombie game.
Development of this game, built on the open-source Irrlicht library, has unfortunately stopped for now.
However, I plan to continue to work on it when I have time, and the source code is being made available to anyone who wishes to contribute and/or use for their personal projects.
